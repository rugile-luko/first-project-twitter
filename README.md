# Twitter project

This project is my first try at coding. I tried to implement and learn as many functions as possible. Started with basic
design, views and forms and moved on with simple ajax and javascript functionality. As this is the first attempt, there
are many things that could be improved but I am keeping this project as a reminder of where I started so I could compare
myself and my projects in the future.

## Getting Started

Below you will find the instructions and requirements on how to install and run this project on your local machine.

### Installing

The first step is to clone the repository.
After that you can create a virtual environment, activate it and install the requirements.txt file:

```
python -m venv env
cd env/Scripts/activate.bat                 // for Windows users
source env/bin/activate                     // for OS X users
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

After successful installation you can start the server:
```
python manage.py runserver
```
